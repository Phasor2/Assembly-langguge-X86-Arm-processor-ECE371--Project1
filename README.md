First, I have to recognize input and output of the project. Here is are simplify the project into black box

Clearly, I can see there are 2 outputs. It’s my goal to design the system calculates the output that I want. In order to obtain these outputs, I must need 2 sub routines. They are Conversion and Average. 
Once, I realize the subroutine I need to design each sub routine in pseudocode so it can be designed in any language, not just assembly langue. 

# PSEUDOCODE
```
Conversion
			if rough value adding into true value 0
			If rough value > 20 adding 1 to into rough value save in true value
			If rough value > 39 adding 3 to into rough value save in true value
			If rough value > 59 adding 7 to into rough value save in true value
If rough value > 79 adding 12 to into rough value save in true value
If rough value > 99 adding 20 to into rough value save in true value
	Average:
			Counter is 16
			While the counter is > 0
Previous Sum add true value save into sum
			Until counter is 0 next step
			Sum dive it into 16 
			Check if rounding 
			Round by adding 1 
			Else return to main program

# TRUTH TABLE
In order to design a perfect system working smoothly without glitch or mistake, I give a trials value and calculate them beforehand. I make a table of these trials value by the time I finish coding I can run them and compare the values from my table to the values output of the program. It’s a really nice technique I figure out when coming across the project problems. This is similar to truth table.

Algorithm Project 1 ECE 371
Mainline 
Main:
Counter R3= 16
Load input pointer Fahrenheit Rough array into R0 half word
Load input pointer Fahrenheit True array into R1 half word
Load input pointer correction factor array into R2 half word
Load input pointer Average in to R7 word
Calling STEP1 (BL)
NOP
Calling STEP2 (BL) 
NOP
STEP1:	Save registers into the stack (R0-R9,R14)
Conversion:
		 
Initialize pointer R2 = 0 correction factor
		+Condition (Check what kind of A/D reading)
			@ Initially R2 pointer is at 0 
			If (R4 > 20): increment pointer R2 for #2 	@ R2= 1
			If (R4 > 39): increment pointer R2 for #2	@ R2=2
			If (R4 > 59): increment pointer R2 for #2 	@ R2= 3
			If (R4 > 79): increment pointer R2 for #2	@ R2=4
			If (R4 > 99): increment pointer R2 for #2	@ R2=5	
		Now I have R2 pointer condition 
		
+Correction (Add the correction factor into Rough value)
			Load half word R0 into R4 (F rough)
			Load half word R1 into R5 (F true)
			Load half word R2 into R6 (correction factor)
			R5 = R4 + R6		        @ Adding correction
Store R5 back R1 array
			R0 increment pointer into #2 @ R0++ for the next rough value
			R1 increment pointer into #2 @ R2++ for the next true value
			R3 = R3 – 1 		        @ decrement counter
			Keep calling conversion BNE Conversion
			Restore the register by popping from the stack (R0-R9, R14)
			Move PC, R14

STEP2: Save registers into the stack (R0-R9,R14)
Average:
	Load half word R1 into R5 (F true)
	Load word R7 into R8 a word (average)
	R6= R5+R6 @ adding for sum 
	R1 increment pointer into #2 @ R1 ++ for next true value
	R3=R3-1 @decrement R3
	If R3 = 0 then next otherwise keep calling Average
	R6 is now the Sum of 16 F true Values
	R9 will mask 4 loIr bit of R6 (R9 will decide how I should rounded for average number)
	R8 = Shift the values to the right 4 bits (This is same as take the value dive by 16)
	Compare R9 and 0x8 if update N flags and Z flags
	If PL plus positive or zero (N clear) Called rounded

END:  			Restore the register by popping from the stack (R0-R9, R14)
			Return to mainline program MOV PC, R14

Rounded:
R8 = R8+1 @ rounded R8 by adding one (round up)
Jump to end
